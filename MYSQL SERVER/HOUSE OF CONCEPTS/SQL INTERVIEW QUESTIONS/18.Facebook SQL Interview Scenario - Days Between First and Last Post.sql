--Scenario
--Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2018, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. 
--Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

--Solution 1: 
SELECT UserId,DATEDIFF(DD,MIN(PostedOn),MAX(PostedOn)) nbrOfDays
FROM PostDetails
WHERE DATEPART(YYYY,PostedOn)='2018'
GROUP BY UserId
HAVING COUNT(PostId)>1;

--Solution 2: 
SELECT 
    UserId, 
    DATEDIFF(DAY, MIN(PostedOn), MAX(PostedOn)) AS nbrOfDays
FROM PostDetails
WHERE YEAR(PostedOn) = 2018
GROUP BY UserId
HAVING COUNT(PostId) > 1;

--Solution 3: 
SELECT 
    UserId,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, FirstPostDate, LastPostDate) AS nbrOfDays
FROM (
    SELECT 
        UserId,
        MIN(PostedOn) AS FirstPostDate,
        MAX(PostedOn) AS LastPostDate,
        COUNT(PostId) AS PostCount
    FROM PostDetails
    WHERE YEAR(PostedOn) = 2018
    GROUP BY UserId
) AS Subquery
WHERE PostCount > 1;
